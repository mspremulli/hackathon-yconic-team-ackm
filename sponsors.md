- API documentation: [docs.senso.ai](http://docs.senso.ai)
- Senso is a single REST layer that sits between your data and your AI agents. We act as the Context OS enabling developers to ingest raw content, spin up an agent-ready context window, and trigger actions anywhere—all via schema-safe JSON.
- A Context OS is a unified knowledge layer for your application: it ingests documents, emails, and web content, normalizes them into schema-safe data, and exposes rule-driven webhooks—enabling developers to add AI agents, chatbots, or workflow automations with minimal integration effort and immediate, reliable context.
- Ping Tomos on Discord for any support!
